/**
 * Exercise 10.4
 *
 * Write a function called `removeEntry()` to remove an entry from a linked
 * list.  The sole argument to the procedure should be a pointer to the list.
 * Have the function remove the entry after the one pointed to by the argument.
 * (Why canâ€™t you remove the entry pointed to by the argument?) You need to use
 * the special structure you set up in exercise 3 to handle the special case of
 * removing the first element from the list.
 */

/**
 * Question explanation
 *
 * The element pointed to directly by the argument to `removeEntry()` can not
 * be removed in the singly linked list case because in order to re-link the
 * list after element removal, access to the previous element is required.
 * However in a singly linked list links only traverse the list in one
 * direction and therefore the previous element is not accessible from the
 * argument.
